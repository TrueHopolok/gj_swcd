# Santa's Warm on Christmas Day

Every child has tried to catch Santa Claus putting presents under the tree. But have you ever wondered what Santa sees from his perspective? I invite you to become Santa Claus and live in a house with children until morning.
You can't leave because the door is frozen and the fireplace must stay lit, so the children don't wake up from the cold. But don't forget about the music box, which needs to be wound up constantly.

Be vigilant and make sure you have time to spell words with the cubes! Or do you want to ruin Christmas for those children?
